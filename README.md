# Leafy_Hospital_Microsoft_genAI_resources
Repo to share the resources used in Leafy Hospital - Microsoft genAI showcase

The repo consists of the artifacts that were mentioned in the blog "AI-Powered Healthcare | MongoDB & Azure".

MongoDB Atlas and Microsoft AI technologies converge in an innovative healthcare solution called "Leafy Hospital," showcasing how cutting-edge technology can transform breast cancer diagnosis and patient care.
This integrated system leverages MongoDB's flexible data platform for unifying operational, metadata, and AI data, while incorporating Microsoft's advanced capabilities including Azure OpenAI, Microsoft Fabric, 
and Power BI to create a comprehensive healthcare analytics and diagnostic solution.

The solution demonstrates three key technological approaches:
**Predictive AI for early detection** using deep learning models to analyze mammograms and predict BI-RADS scores;
  * The repo includes two models that can be trained and used to predict BI-RADS scores and to classify the cancer as malignant or benign.
**Generative AI for workflow automation,** featuring vector search capabilities and RAG-based chatbots for intelligent information retrieval;
  * The repo includes the chatbot code which takes three different contexts into consideration
  * The repo also includes the code to add documentation to MongoDB Atlas by chunking, vectorising the chunks and inserting into MongoDB collection
**Advanced Analytics** that combines real-time operational insights with long-term trend analysis through Power BI integration.
